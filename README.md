# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I'm a fisrt year Robotics MS student at the University of Michigan. I did my undergrad in Chile, majoring in Robotics and Electrical Engineering.

## ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on:
- [Soft-Bubble compliant contact gap bridge](https://github.com/jneyzaguirre1/Soft-bubble-sim2real): I am researching on generating soft-bubble visuo-tactile sensor outputs conditioned on simulated depth images, bridging the gap between simulation and real-world applications.

## ðŸš€ Work experience
- [Oddness Technologies](https://www.oddness.ai/): Hardware and Software Developer. Worked in the mechanical, electrical and firmware design of the company's robots. Part of the Picker-robot, Cumpa, and [Sierrabot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM8xKJk1jqE) projects.
- [Monterey Bay Aquarium Research institude (MBARI)](https://www.mbari.org/): Seafloor Mapping Lab Intern. Worked in stereo camera calibrationfor 3D reconstructions and 2D mosaic generation.
- [CoMPAS LAB](https://compas.ing.uc.cl/?page_id=667&lang=es): Designed and manufactured a budget flow microscope for phytoplankton analysis in order to mitigate the losses in the salmon industry. 

## ðŸŒ± Class projects
- [ROB 550 Robotics Systems Laboratory](https://github.com/jneyzaguirre1/MBot_forklift): Multidisciplinary laboratory course with exposures to sensing, reasoning, and acting for physically-embodied systems. The class is divided in two labs through the semester: Armlab and Botlab.

## ðŸ’» Skills
- Programming: Python, C/C++, Matlab, Linux
- Frameworks: Numpy, OpenCV, Pytorch
- CAD/CAE: Fusion 360, Inventor, Eagle.
- Microcontrollers: TI MSP430, Atmel AtMega328, Arduinos.
- FPGA: Verilog.
- Manufacturing: 3D printing, Laser cut, Sheet metal, PCB design and assembly (SMT, THM)
