# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I'm a passionate second-year Robotics MS student at the University of Michigan. I have a background in Robotics and Electrical Engineering, and I am dedicated to creating innovative robotic solutions that can bridge the gap between academic research and real-world applications.

## ðŸ”­ I'm currently working at:
- **[ROAHM LAB](https://www.roahmlab.com/):**
  - Using language embedded Gaussian Splats for open-language manipulation.
- **[MMINT LAB](https://www.mmintlab.com/):**
  - [Tactile Neural De-rendering](https://www.mmintlab.com/research/tactile-neural-derendering/) Reconstructing local 3D representation of an object from its tactile signature by leveraging generative models.   

## ðŸŒ± Class projects
- [ROB 550 Robotics Systems Laboratory](https://github.com/jneyzaguirre1/MBot_forklift):
  - *Summary*: Multidisciplinary laboratory course with exposures to sensing, reasoning, and acting for physically-embodied systems. The class is divided in two labs through the semester: Armlab and Botlab.
- [ROB 599 Deep Learning for robotic perception](https://github.com/jneyzaguirre1/dino_evaluation):
  - *Summary*: Deep Leaning class focused on robotics perception. This class' final project consist on reviewing, checking, and improving a recent paper, in my case "Emerging Properties in Self-Supervised Vision Transformers (DINO)".

## ðŸš€ Work experience
- **[Oddness Technologies](https://www.oddness.ai/):**
  - *Role*: Hardware and Software Developer
  - *Projects*: Picker-robot, Cumpa, and [Sierrabot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM8xKJk1jqE).
  - *Responsibilities*: Mechanical, electrical, and firmware design.
- **[Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI)](https://www.mbari.org/):**
  - *Role*: Seafloor Mapping Lab Intern
  - *Responsibilities*: Stereo camera calibration for 3D reconstructions and 2D mosaic generation.
- **[CoMPAS LAB](https://compas.ing.uc.cl/?page_id=667&lang=es):**
  - *Role*: Research engineer
  - *Project*: Designed and manufactured a budget flow microscope for phytoplankton analysis to help mitigate losses in the salmon industry.
